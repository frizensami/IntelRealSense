#Intel Realsense Data Recording Program

**Purpose**

Simple high performance timestamped Intel Realsense to CSV file data logging and conversion program. 

**Capabilities**

Records as many Intel Realsense parameters as possible and saves to CSV. Also has decent GUI for inspection of parameters in real time.

**Usage**

As long as Intel Realsense is connected, data will automatically be logged as long as program is open.

NOTE: Program does not seem to work for latest SDK update, program was created for version

•	Intel(R) RealSense(TM) SDK 4.0.0.52526 
•	Intel(R) RealSense(TM) Depth Camera Manager 1.2.14.24922 

Hopefully someone can recompile this project for futures releases
